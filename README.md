This is a concept project for a lunch & mearn presentation. I am going to use a Photon Particle with a magnetic reed switch to monitor if bathroom doors are open or closed. At work, one can lose valuable development time looking for a place to water the lawn or lay some logs. So, with this web interface an employee can see what bathrooms are open and go there.

Release 0:
Dashboard with one monitor on one bathroom.
There will be either a green door or an 'open' status when the door is open
conversely, there will be a red door or a 'closed' status when the door is closed

Release 1:
Dashboard with multiple bathrooms
If someone has been in there for more than 2 minutes create a status of yellow or 'danger'
for a minute after departure.
Add ability to 'reserve' a bathroom, if the door does not close within 1 minute of reservation
then it will be set back to open unless taken by someone else
Add bathroom status lights, in case someone reserves it and another person doesn't have a chance
to check online interface.

Release 2:
???? Mobile app????
???? Notify when something needs to be cleaned????
Eventually want UserIds, BuildingId, and generic Door for eventual home automation
maybe include time spent in rooms?
